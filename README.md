Browsers are more modern than ever. You can know the battery of your laptop, vibrate your mobile or know your position. JavaScript (and browsers) are in everything and can do more things than you think.

On the other hand, the API of this news features are too primitive: the browsers just provide the minimal interface, and is necessary write a little code around it. Also, each browser have specific vendor and exist minimal changes in the way to access a this methods.

Parrot is a high-level wrapper for browser features: It's provide you concise methods for use this features today.

## Get Started

The design of code is modular. Only use the wrappers that you need. All code is minifier and prepare for production.

For install the library use `bower`:

bower install parrotjs
bower install parrot-module-device
```

We offers different builds depending on what you need

**Standalone (without DOM Handler)**

Just parrot code. You need to provide an DOM handler:

```html
<script src="bower_components/parrotjs/dist/parrot.standalone.js"></script>
```

**Standard (with QuoJS, jQuery or ZeptoJS as DOM Handler)**

Parrot code + DOM Handler. We have 3 different builds:

```html
<script src="bower_components/parrotjs/dist/parrot.quo.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/parrotjs/dist/parrot.jquery.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/parrotjs/dist/parrot.zepto.js"></script>
```

For use different modules, just chain the modules in your `html`:

```html
<script src="bower_components/parrotjs/dist/parrot.quo.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/parrot-module-device/dist/parrot.device.js"></script>
```

Remember that for `production` you can concatenate all files that you need in one creating a simple Gulp/Grunt task.
