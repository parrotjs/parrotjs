> Client library to connect your frontend application with whatever sails backend.

Parrot helps you to connect your frontend with you API backend. You only need to say to Parrot what to do, and Parrot will do the hard work!

At this moment, Parrot supports:

- Registering different environments (development, production, testing,...).
- Registering different URLs with different protocols (http, sockets) and easier AJAX requests.
- Managing uniformly sessionStorage and localStorage.
- Chain methods for make easy concatenate different actions.

For the future features, check [Roadmap](https://github.com/sailorjs/Parrotjs/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) section.

## Install

```bash
bower install parrotjs
```

## Browser Compatibility

## Usage

At this moment, Parrot has two dependencies:

- [jsurl](https://github.com/Mikhus/jsurl), a Polyfill of [URL Objects](http://www.w3.org/TR/url/)
- [QuoJS](https://github.com/soyjavi/QuoJS/), [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) or [Zepto](https://github.com/madrobby/zepto) for AJAX handler.

We offer different builds depending on what you need.

### Standalone

Just Parrot code, without dependencies. Use it when you have a custom build with your other frontend dependencies:

```html
<script src="bower_components/parrotjs/dist/parrot.standalone.js"></script>
```

Note that if you don't provide `jsurl` and an AJAX handler parrot will not work!

### Standard

Parrot code with the minimum dependencies (only `jsurl`). Use it when you provide your own ajax handler in your frontend dependencies:

```html
<script src="bower_components/parrotjs/dist/parrot.js"></script>
```

### QuoJS, jQuery or ZeptoJS

Parrot code with all dependencies that it needs. Use it when you want to provide AJAX handler and you don't want to complicate yourself:

```html
<script src="bower_components/parrotjs/dist/parrot.quo.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/parrotjs/dist/parrot.jquery.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/parrotjs/dist/parrot.zepto.js"></script>
```

## API

The library is divided in different namespaces:

### Basic

This method is available in `Parrot` namespace. This is the basic method that you need yo set up the library and to know the current version.

#### .version

It returns the version of the library.

```coffee
Parrot.version
# => '0.11.27'
```

#### .environment

It returns the environment that you are using at this moment.

```coffee
Parrot.environment
# => 'development'
```

The default environment is `development`.

#### .language

It returns the language that you want to use in the requests with your API's endpoints.

```coffee
Parrot.language
# => 'en'
```

The default language is obtained from `navigator.language`, which is the language of the browser of the user.

#### .ajax(&lt;Object&gt; or &lt;String&gt;)

Returns the result of AJAX request.

The defaults options for whatever ajax request are:

```coffee
method       : 'get'
send         : {}
headers      : {}
async        : true
datatype     : 'json'
content_type : 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
```

##### Using URL Objects

It exists different ways to provide the URL of the AJAX request, but the most common pattern is to give a `Parrot.url` object:

```coffee
Parrot.url.ajax Parrot.url.login(), (err, result) ->
```

If you want to write less code:

```coffee
Parrot.url.ajax 'login', (err, result) ->
```

Maybe you need to modify setting of the URL Object before the ajax request:

```coffee
Parrot.url.ajax Parrot.url.login(send:user), (err, result) ->
```

in short version could be:

```coffee
Parrot.url.ajax 'login', send:user, (err, result) ->
```

#### Using simple URL's

Also you can provide a URL that you are not registered but that follows a `Parrot.url` similar interface (extra field for the `url` because it is not calculated based on the `Parrot.environment`).

```coffee
object = url: 'http://echo.jsontest.com/key/value/one/two', method: 'GET'
Parrot.url.ajax object, (err, result) ->
```

Is it possible a short version of this piece of code? of course!

```coffee
Parrot.url.ajax 'http://echo.jsontest.com/key/value/one/two', (err, result) ->
```

Not problem if you need to specify another options of the AJAX or as URL Object:

```coffee
Parrot.url.ajax 'http://echo.jsontest.com/key/value/one/two', async:false, send:user (err, result) ->
```

### Endpoint

This method is available in `Parrot.endpoint` namespace:

#### .add(&lt;Object&gt;)

registers a new endpoint. Object must have:

```coffee
name : 'development'
url  : 'http://localhost:1337'
```

When you register an endpoint it is accesible in the `Parrot.endpoint` namespace:

```coffee
Parrot.endpoint.development()
# => http://localhost:1337
```

#### .set(&lt;String&gt;)

Sets the default environment of `Parrot.environment`. It's important because the URL's depend on the URL path register in the environment.

```coffee
Parrot.environment.set('production')
```

#### .remove(&lt;String&gt;)

Deletes a environment from the namespace

```coffee
Parrot.environment.remove('testing')
```

### URL Management

URL Management makes easy to do ajax or sockets requests with your backend. In order to do it, you need first to register the URL's. Each URL has a different schema as `protocol`, `path` and/or `query`.

This method is available in `Parrot.url` namespace:

#### .add(&lt;Object&gt;)

Registers a new URL. The minimum information you need to check is:

```coffee
name: 'login'
```

You can specify the same options that ajax options and other options specific of the URL:

```coffee
path  : 'user/find'
query : ['sort','id asc']
```

Remember that in a URL Object the `url` is equal to:

```
<endpoint URL>/[url.path]/[url.query]
```
 
Now, the URL is available in the `Parrot.url` namespace:

```coffee
Parrot.url.login()
# => { method: 'GET', protocol: 'http', path: 'user/login', query: null }
```

If you want update some value, you can provide an argument when you call the method. For example, for login you need to send the user information to the server:

```coffee
user = username: 'kiko', password: 'nerd'
Parrot.url.login(send: user)
```

Check AJAX section for know how to update values in the moment of the request and know the short version of each URL Object.

#### .remove(&lt;String&gt;)

Delete a URL from the namespace.

```coffee
Parrot.url.remove('logout')
```

### Storage

This module is a little interface for using the same pattern in `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`. Both are different namespaces: `Parrot.local` and `Parrot.session`. But both methods are the same.

Remember that the only difference between `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` is the time of life of the information in the browser. `localStorage` is persisten and only is deleted if you clean it. `sessionStorage` is only for the session (for example, if you close and open the tab, disappear).

#### .set(&lt;key&gt;, &lt;value&gt;)

Stores something in `session` or `local` storage, depending on the namespace that you uses.

```coffee
Parrot.local.set('foo', 'bar')
```

and the key is available in the namespace:

```coffee
Parrot.local.foo()
# => 'bar'
```

You can also store objects:

```coffee
object = foo:'bar'
Parrot.local.set('myObject', object)
# => 'bar'
```

And the object is directly available in the namespace:

```coffee
Parrot.local.myObject()
# => {foo: 'bar'}
```

#### .clear(&lt;keys...&gt;)

Deletes the key and the value from the `local` or `session` storage:

```coffee
Parrot.local.clear('one')
Parrot.local.one()
# => undefined
```

Note that you can delete different keys in one sentence:

```coffee
Parrot.local.clear 'one', 'foo'
```

#### .clearAll()

Clears all the elements from tal` or `session` storage:

```coffee
Parrot.local.removeAll()
Parrot.session.removeAll()
```

#### .size()

Returns the length of the `local` or `session` storage:

```coffee
Parrot.local.size()
# => 0
Parrot.session.size()
# => 8
```

#### .isAvailable(&lt;key&gt;)

Returns if a certain value if available in the `local` or `session` storage:

```coffee
Parrot.local.isAvailable('foo')
# => false
Parrot.local.isAvailable('bar')
# => true
```

### Storage Session Helpers

`Parrot.session` has a special helpers to make easy save and retrieve the session. It's similar to the standard actions, but you have to write less code for do the same.

If you don't provide a key in `Parrot.session`, the default key is `session`. For example, if you want to store in session a object only write:

```coffee
Parrot.session.set(user)
```

Automatically is associated with the key `session`. If you need to `get`, `clear` or check if `isAvailable` write the command without parameter and is resolved with `session` key:

```coffee
Parrot.session.get()
Parrot.session.clear()
Parrot.session.isAvailable()
# => false
```
