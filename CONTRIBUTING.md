We provide you the basic scaffold that you need to write a module. 

Just clone the boilerplate for start to create a new module:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/parrotjs/parrot-boilerplate parrot-module-newModule
```

Some things you have to consider are:

1) First check that the module doesn't exist.

2) We like write code under CoffeeScript, but you can use Javascript or another JS-Preprocessor (as LiveScript). Your are the owner of your module and you can use the language that you feel more confortable.

3) Try to write the minimal code for do the things and use the common code of the core for resolve common problems.

4) It's important that you write a documentation about your module as well. Follow the documentation schema (see SailorJS Team modules).

5) If you need help in the process or you would you like that the ParrotJS team would like to write a module open a issue.
